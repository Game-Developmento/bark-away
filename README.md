## Welcome to Bark Away, version 1.0

In this version of the game, you will find a house with furniture and a dog with simple animations. We have added user interface displays to show tasks and interactions that can be triggered when the player is close to certain objects. Objects will spawn according to the tasks, and will be deactivated once the player completes them.

To control the player character, you can use the following keys:

- W: move forward

- A: move left

- S: move backward

- D: move right

- E: interact with objects

We hope you enjoy playing Bark Away and have fun exploring the house and interacting with the dog and objects!
